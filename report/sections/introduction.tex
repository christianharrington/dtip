This report describes the design and implementation of a simple functional programming language, using dependent types. This programming language is based on the simply typed lambda calculus with several common extensions, as described in Types and Programming Languages by Benjamin C. Pierce\,\cite{Pierce:TypeSystems}. The programming language is not interesting in and of itself. Languages like this have been implemented thousands of times in as many programming languages. Instead, we will focus on how dependent types can be used in the abstract representation of the language to increase our confidence that the implementation is correct. We will not implement a concrete syntax nor lexer/parser for the language. Our approach is inspired by the ``well-typed interpreter'' presented by Augustsson and Carlsson\,\cite{Augustsson99anexercise}. 

The abstract representation, along with all other components, was written in Idris\,\cite{Idris}, a dependently typed general purpose programming language developed primarily by Edwin Brady of the University of St Andrews.  

Programming with dependent types is not yet widespread, so this paper has been written so readers with no previous knowledge of dependent types should be able to understand it. Besides general programming experience, the only prerequisite for understanding this paper is proficiency with a functional programming language. Haskell is a good choice, since the syntax of Idris is very similar. All code examples in this paper are written in Idris.

\subsection{Structure}
In Section~\ref{sec:background}, we start by giving a quick overview of the simply typed lambda calculus. This is followed by a brief introduction to dependent types. Then, in Section~\ref{sec:the-simply-typed-lambda-calculus}, a na\"{i}ve representation of our programming language is presented. This will serve as the base for our well-typed representation in Section~\ref{sec:a-well-typed-expression-language}. In Section~\ref{sec:type-checking}, a type-checking system is introduced, which lets us transform expressions from the na\"{i}ve to the well-typed representation. As the final link in the chain, a compiler and stack machine are described in Section~\ref{sec:stack-machine}. This lets us compile our well-typed representation to a ``well-stacked'' program. In Section~\ref{sec:partiality}, the consequences of introducing general recursion into the programming language are discussed. Section~\ref{sec:related-work} lists related work, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} offers concluding thoughts.
