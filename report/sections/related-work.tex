\paragraph{Well-typed interpreter}
The idea for the well-typed interpreter came from Lennart Augustsson and Magnus Carlsson\,\cite{Augustsson99anexercise}. They describe how to implement a simple expression language, much like our own, in a programming language with dependent types. This implementation served as the starting point for our solution, which extends it with several new terms. 

\paragraph{Stack machines using dependent types}
Conor McBride's keynote at the International Conference on Functional Programming in 2012, titled ``Agda-curious?''\,\cite{McBride:2012:AEP:2364527.2364529}, included a stack machine using dependent types which served as an inspiration for our stack machine. Edwin Brady implemented also implemented a stack machine that tracks stack effects using dependent types\,\cite{Brady:WS-idr}. It is part of his implementation of the Whitespace language in Idris.

\paragraph{Verified C compiler}
Xavier Leroy has implemented a verified C compiler in Coq. He has verified it by modeling the semantics of both the source code and the compiled machine code, and the proven that the compiler preserves the semantics of the source code\,\cite{Leroy_formalverification}. This same methodology could be used to prove the compile function described in Section\,\ref{sec:stack-machine}. We have already modeled the semantics for the well-typed expression language in Section\,\ref{sec:partiality}, so if we did the same for the instructions, we would be able to verify the correctness of our compile function.
